# RecipeManager: V0.1.1
This document descripes the changes in the Version 0.1.1.  
For the complete bug and feature list see github issues.

## fixed Bugs:

### Bug #14:
#### Issue:
It was not possible to add pictures after recipe creation when no initial picture was set. This was due to the control panel being placed over the image, and therefore not displaying when no image was deposited.  

#### Fix:
This problem was solved by adding the default placeholder to the recipe details page as well.

### Bug #13:
#### Issue:
Here, elements in the recipe card view were sometimes displayed twice as soon as the user went to another page and then clicked the "Browser-back button".
#### Fix:
The problem was solved by checking if the element was already added and adding it to the recipleist only if it is unique.

### Removing Debugger:
Some debugger were removed.

## known Issues:
there are no known Issues at the moment.
